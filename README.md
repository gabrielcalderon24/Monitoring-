## Introduction  
Colombia currently implements health taxes and specific control measures with the specific objective of reducing health risks associated with the consumption of some products. 
In this case, we focus on three specific consumptions: Tobacco, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages. 
Monitoring systems must focus and cover all value chain of public policy in health taxes: Taxes modify prices, which lead to changes in consumption, 
household income and public revenue. Therefore, it's fundamental to have indicators in every stage of the chain, in terms of affordabilityy, consumption, 
public revenue and illicit trade. 

## Tobacco 
- Tobacco consumption (in cigarette units) according to the ECV ("Encuesta nacional de calidad de vida") and ENCSP ("Encuesta nacional de consumo de sustancias psicoáctivas") 
- Public revenue of Tobacco Taxes- Ministry of finance compilator (CHIP) and ADRES (Administradora de los Recursos del Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud) data
- Apparent consumption (National production + Imports - Exports) according to DANE and DIAN data

## Alcohol 
- Alcohol household expenditure according to the ECV (Encuesta nacional de calidad de vida)  
- Public revenue from alcohol taxes- Ministry of finance compilator (CHIP) and ADRES (Administradora de los Recursos del Sistema General de Seguridad Social en Salud)
- Apparent alcohol consumption (National production + Imports - Exports) based on DANE and DIAN data

## Sugar-sweetened beverages 
Taxes in Sugar-sweetened beverages are relatively recent, implemented only after tax reform in 2022. Therefore, for the time being, we cannot construct all indicators for this product 
- Household expenditure and consumption prevalence according to the ECV ("Encuesta nacional de calidad de vida"), including ultra-processed products.
